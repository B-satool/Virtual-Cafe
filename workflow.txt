WBAD Project Milestone 1 - WorkFlows

Workflow 1: User Joining or Creating a Study Room

    Workflow Specification
    This workflow describes how a user enters the application and joins an existing study room or creates a new one.

    Step-by-Step Description
        1. The user opens the Virtual Café / Study Room web application.
        2. The system displays available public study rooms along with an option to create a private room.
        3. The user selects one of the following:
          - Joins a public room, or
          - Creates a private room using a room code.
        4. If joining a private room, the system validates the room code.
        5. Upon successful validation, the system adds the user to the room.
        6. The room interface is displayed showing:
          - Current participants
          - Room capacity
          - Room status (Study or Break)
        7. The system updates presence indicators in real time when users join or leave the room.

    Key Features & Functionalities
        - Public and private room access
        - Room creation and joining
        - Access control via invite codes
        - Real-time presence updates

Workflow 2: Synchronized Pomodoro Study Session

    Workflow Specification
    This workflow defines how users participate in a shared, synchronized study and break session within a room.

    Step-by-Step Description
        1. The room host starts the Pomodoro timer.
        2. The system initializes the timer and synchronizes it across all room participants.
        3. All users see the same countdown timer and current mode (Study or Break).
        4. When the study session ends, the system automatically transitions to break mode.
        5. The timer continues cycling between study and break sessions until stopped or reset.
        6. If a user joins the room mid-session, the system syncs their timer with the current session state.
        7. If a user refreshes the page, the timer state is restored from the backend.
        8. The host can pause, reset, or restart the timer if needed.

    Key Features & Functionalities
        - Shared Pomodoro timer
        - Real-time synchronization
        - Automatic session transitions
        - Handling edge cases (mid-session join, refresh, host leave)

Workflow 3: In-Room Collaboration and Focus Environment

    Workflow Specification
    This workflow explains how users collaborate and customize their focus environment within a study room.

    Step-by-Step Description
        1. After joining a room, the user accesses the shared task list.
        2. The user can add, edit, delete, or mark tasks as completed.
        3. All task list updates are instantly visible to other room members.
        4. The user enables or disables ambient background sounds such as rain or café noise.
        5. The user adjusts volume settings locally without affecting other participants.
        6. The interface visually reflects the room’s current mode (Study or Break) to support focus.

    Key Features & Functionalities
        - Shared task board per room
        - Real-time task updates
        - Ambient sound controls (local)
        - Visual room status indicators
