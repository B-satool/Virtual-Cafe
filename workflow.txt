Workflow 2: Synchronized Pomodoro Study Session

    Workflow Specification
    This workflow defines how users participate in a shared, synchronized study and break session within a room.

    Step-by-Step Description
        1. The room host starts the Pomodoro timer.
        2. The system initializes the timer and synchronizes it across all room participants.
        3. All users see the same countdown timer and current mode (Study or Break).
        4. When the study session ends, the system automatically transitions to break mode.
        5. The timer continues cycling between study and break sessions until stopped or reset.
        6. If a user joins the room mid-session, the system syncs their timer with the current session state.
        7. If a user refreshes the page, the timer state is restored from the backend.
        8. The host can pause, reset, or restart the timer if needed.

    Key Features & Functionalities
        - Shared Pomodoro timer
        - Real-time synchronization
        - Automatic session transitions
        - Handling edge cases (mid-session join, refresh, host leave)
